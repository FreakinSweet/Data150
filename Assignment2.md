**Introduction**

The purpose of this research is to assess the nature of poverty in Bolivia, and whether growing sustainable forestry would be a viable path to bringing its citizens out of poverty. By the usage of Remotely-Sensed (RS) data from the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), and survey data gathered from various sources such as the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics and the Bolivian Central Bank.



This work will build on previous research by Vargas, Mercado, Vos, O'Doherty, Pellegrini, De Sy, Muller, Nebel, Contreras-Hermosilla, and their teams, and will incorporate new methods to implement
