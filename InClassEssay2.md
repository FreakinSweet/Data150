## In-Class Essay 2

​	In the City of God, during the 60s through the 80s, the drug trade was rampant in the city. Crime was ever increasing, and control over drug operations and sales was the source of it. Zipf's law, scale, and Tobler's First Law of Geography provide good evidence that social networks were central to the urbanization of the city, and that the growth of the city during that time depended on the growth of those networks.

​	Firstly is how Zipf's law ties into the growth of the city. As the drug trade shifted hands over and over, it increased in efficiency. The next drug lord would improve upon the efforts of the last, increasing their business and their grip on society, over and over again. New, stronger, more efficient individuals would come to take the place of the prior, usually through force of will and violence. How Zipf's law ties into this is that as the power of one individual or small group of individuals increased, their lifespan inversely decreased. The highest ranked influencers in the trade would be the primary targets for newcomers and new opposition. Like all social networks, the most popular individuals receive much of the resources. As the operations run by Li'l Ze, Benny, and Knockout Ned increased in scale, their likelihood of falling increased too, ultimately resulting in the death them all. The next round of "newcomers" was revealed as the movie came to a close: the runts. They were handed guns and power by the former gang leaders, and most likely would become the next round of gangsters, probably establishing a new, more powerful network upon the ashes of the old one. The constant ebbing and flowing of the network and its ties is what pushed urbanization in the city - newcomers would make new demands which their little empires had to fulfill, which brought in wealth. Even if the means of attaining the ends were not necessarily moral, the drug business was certainly effective at bringing resources into the city, and expanding the social ties which it had. 

​	Secondly is how scale affected the drug operations. Throughout the movie, the stories of the children were followed as they grew into adults. They began powerless, small-scale, not being tied to the drug business much. As they grew older, the older siblings began to trust the younger, eventually allowing the younger to participate in robberies and other minor part of the trade. As the younger were initiated through crime (such as when Li'l Dice/Li'l Ze went and killed many at the motel, or when the new-blood was forced to kill one of the Runts), they officially became attached to the network. The scale would increase as more and more were brought in, expanding the power of the network hierarchically, but at the same time, allowing for more loose ends, seeding distrust. Ultimately the town split into the two factions supporting Li'l Ze and Knockout Ned, who in their fighting destroyed much life, opportunity, and property. As was said in the movie, they eventually forgot what they were fighting for. Fighting became their lives, and they only knew violence - but I digress. It is that increase in scale which brought business and prosperity into the city, increasing its social network even outside the city itself.

​	Lastly is how the City of God's urbanization is tied to Tobler's First Law of Geography. It was through the young's older friends that they were introduced into the network. The friends and close relatives of the children were ultimately the ones to raise the children, and the ones who taught them how to live. For those that were already working for the drug empire, they raised their little brothers and other young friends to take what they want, and do as they please. While individuals like Knockout Ned tried to remain disconnected from the gangs, and tried to maintain their way of life, gang violence ultimately seeped in. He was surrounded by an empire who wanted him as an asset, and he became that. After raping his wife, he was united with the gang - not because he wanted to, but because he had to. His nearness to the drug trade was what made it almost inevitable that he join it, and the stronger his resistance against it, the greater the chance he would be merged with it. In so doing, the network was expanded, and the city was expanded.
