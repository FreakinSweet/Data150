# Response to the Jahan Podcast and Rosling TED Talk

### Q1: Selim Jahan introduces the idea that for far too long the paradigm of economic development has dominated the idea of human development. Jahan states that while income is critical it is not an end, and that human development is about expanding the richness of life, not the richness of the economy within which human beings live. 
#### - What are some of the targetted issues that Jahan examples as requiring focus throughout the world? 
#### - Elaborate further on Jahan’s definition of human development.
#### - What are the different measures incorporated into the Human Development Index that serve to capture the breadth and focus of each countries’ average achievement?

### A1:

P1: Jahan discussed issues such as child labor, getting women in the workplace, media & information dispersal, and poverty.

P2: He discusses the idea that human development cannot be measured by one variable – it isn’t just income, or infant mortality, or the fertility rate, etc, it is all of these things in tandem which must be used to assess the well-being of a country. We can’t just look at the door, we need to see the whole house. 

P3: The factors that make up the HDI are life expectancy, average and expected years of schooling, and the GNI per capita.

### Q2: Hans Rosling states that “we underestimate the tremendous social change that often precedes economic change” and proceeds to provide several examples. 
#### - What were some of the examples Rosling presented where health appeared to be a precursor to wealth? 
#### - What was Rosling’s warning regarding the dangers of using averages when describing development?

### A2: 

P1: Rosling showed that the United Arab Emirates gained great financial wealth (sweet oil money) very quickly, but that its child mortality rate did not decrease correspondingly. Similarly with Brazil, its average income has increased since the 60s, but the child mortality rate hasn't changed so much.

P2: Rosling warned that these great HDI issues can hide behind the "average" statistics of whole countries. While an entire country may have a good or great GDP/GNI, that's not specific enough. Take for example the United States, where the average New Yorker is going to make more than the average Montanan. This example only considers income, but, it still applies to the bigger picture - if we only look at averages, we'll overlook those who need aid and investment.
