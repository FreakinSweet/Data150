A paper written in 2015 by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This paper discusses how Bolivia reduced poverty from 2000-2015, and what need to be done to continue that trend and ensure that it does not reverse. It was found that the most significant cause of poverty reduction was "labor income growth a the bottom end of the income distribution." This is for many reasons - growth of the manufacturing and service sectors in Bolivia, the addition of minimum wage laws and social policy that has focused on redistributing the wealth within the state, and the "commodity boom", or the introduction of cheap imports from China, Brazil, and Chile among others. 

New jobs in the manufacturing and service industries were great for reducing the bar of education necessary to get a job. According to multiple metrics of income inequality, Bolivia has successfully had reduced it. Compared to other regions in the world (Asia, Europe, Africa, different sub-regions of those regions) Latin America is relatively better-off, but still Bolivia has the least freedom of opportunity in all Latin America, based on the metric of poverty rates and therefore people's means of will. 

He goes on to talk about economic growth, having been caused by highly-priced international exports, and public investment. He then cites two other papers, which suggested that public investment had the strongest impact on reducing poverty, by improving infrastructure (roads, electrical access, sanitation, etc) which enabled freedom. 

In recent years, Bolivia’s central bank has stabilized greatly after placing reliance on the US dollar, comparing its own dollar value to the United States’ to assess stability and determine when to enact stabilizing measures on the economy. In doing this, the Bolivian currency is more stable, and so too is the country, allowing for even further improvements.

Another good factor in economic growth has been remittances, where citizens of Bolivia make money working in other countries (the US, Spain, and Argentina are given as examples). So much so that it contributed around 3.5% to the Argentinian GDP in 2014. He then talks about certain social policies in Bolivia, which specifically seek to improve education and health, which will reduce poverty and inequality in giving its citizens the tools to further improve their own country.

This paper posits that poverty in Bolivia is due to a "vicious cycle" due to race and gender discrimination. At face value (before having read the paper) I agree that there is perhaps a vicious cycle, but disagree that ethnic and gender discrimination are the "self-reinforcing factors"... I posit that if so, if the people of Bolivia believe that they are oppressed, then to an extent yes, but is that they believe that they are oppressed that is the issue, not the cause of poverty. A people who are confident in their free will are a people who are, or will make themselves free... this is what I have to say, however, not the paper.

This paper mentions a previous one by Mercado (part author of this paper), which supposed that the poverty in Bolivia was due to a vicious cycle of lacking education. It held that household incomes were so low that children were then forced to opt into the labor force as opposed to going to school, depriving them of the education necessary to take on high-skill, high-paying jobs. The new paper doesn't deny the old, but asserts that it is ethnic and gender discrimination which truly inhibit growth by demotivation and discouragement, that they are the fundamental problem.

The slowing of economic growth in recent years is caused by the lack of technological improvement in rural areas, and as the older paper said it's the lack of social mobility, which is the freedom of opportunity of any given individual in a society to "climb the social hierarchy", and claim a better job position if they will it. The paper then says that is is fundamentally not education but discrimination which is causing the vicious cycle. This is as far as the paper goes for worded argument. 

It goes on to describe metrics by which discrimination is measured. Poverty levels were measured by ethnic groups, and it was found that poverty was higher among the indigenous peoples than the non-indigenous. This paper shows the facts, the statistics, that the indigenous peoples are more impoverished, and that women are more impoverished as well, and asserts that the causation behind this correlation is discrimination.

**NOTE**: This paper was written BEFORE the economic boom of the 2000s and early 2010s which brought great growth to the Bolivians. This is also before big data, another interesting thing to note. 

This paper analyzes what effects and how effective policy changes in the mid 80s to early 90s were in reducing Bolivian poverty ("It's economics, stupid!"). The reform policies of the past decade (1987-1997) weren't greatly effective, and where there were gains, those gains came at the cost of loss of other economic freedoms. The Bolivian government made four distinct policy reforms which aimed to reduce long-term poverty and inequality: economic reforms, social reforms, social safety net reforms, and administrative/institutional reforms. 

The economy was stabilized and hyperinflation terminated in 1985 when the exchange rate was unified, public spending was greatly reduced, and wage/price regulations were removed. The economy was deregulated greatly with the intent of stimulating later growth (perhaps this manifested itself in the growth of the early 21st century?). 

But, growth in and of itself is not what ends poverty thus enabling freedom - it is employment growth, and technological advancement insofar as it relates to managing the economy (in industry shifts, but also in the tools which we use to manage the economy). The paper then asserts that its purpose is not to assess the viability/effectiveness of social reforms but just to present the facts, and assert which demographics should be targeted by poverty assistance institutions. 

Then, though, what is poverty, and where is the line drawn? Two ideas are presented: "Direct Poverty," or poverty as the lack of income necessary to provide one's household with food and basic needs. Or, "Indirect Poverty," with poverty as having significantly less than those in your community (aside: and this community, I posit, is just like those we see on that map in Africa when it was divided into 20, then 30, the 40 communities).

__NOTE__: I may have gone a little astray from the main topic here, which is, how can we use data science to assess human development and give them greater freedom of opportunity

This book is as fresh as it gets, having been published only late last year. It talks of contemporary Bolivian issues, involving poverty, social issues, institutional issues, all as relevant and recent as possible. This is a great source! 

This book attacks "the core" of the issue, which it posits as the will of its people (exactly what I had been thinking). If the people will a tyrant into office, so it shall be. This is the problem that O'Doherty talks about - that tyranny is not only the responsibility of the "tyrant and his henchmen, but also with the tyrant's subjects, who actually empower the tyrant to become their ruler, either consciously or subconsciously" (page 33). It is on this idea that I personally recommend Thomas Jefferson's suggestion that every 19 years we rewrite the constitution, or maybe every 200-250 years instead, as the one they made has lasted at least that long. It is ultimately in the Bolivian peoples' hands to create their future. Tyrants become frighteningly attractive in the face of uncertainty, and the people give them a god-like power to tell them right and wrong.

This is outside of the realm of data science and statistics, and gets at an issue which both fields seek to solve - how do we help people pursue happiness, and give them freedom? How do we bring people out of poverty, which is the state of having too little to afford basic survival needs. Even this definition is not "definite", as what it is that brings poverty begs the question, "What do people really need?". Do they need the freedom of opportunity? Do they need equality of opportunity?

People are losing trust in the institutions of Bolivia, and so are beginning to rebel against them. (I could personally posit that this has the Four Turnings theory in mind, or fits within it, but who am I to say). Protests are breaking out, and the tyrannical government is suppressing the voice of its people, by killing the protesters: "Roiled by mass protests at least 32 people have died since then, most of them reportedly in alleged police and army crackdowns". 

This only just touches on the topics this book explores, I should explore it further. It is a full book, after all.

This paper holds that to reduce poverty in Bolivia, a forestry sector should be funded to stimulate the economy and create jobs. It also concludes that there are certain "policy objectives" of the forestry industry of Bolivia, but they are not being met in the face of lacking enforcement. The vast forests of Bolivia are ripe for picking, the environmental costs of picking them aside. Investing in Bolivian forestry would mean investing in Bolivians, as through exporting those goods they would then make capital, hopefully bringing the poorest among them out of poverty in exchange for low-skill labor. 

Forestry is particularly attractive in the sense that the rural Bolivians have the highest rates of poverty, and in being the least technologically developed, and isolated from opportunity, giving them a forestry industry gives them jobs, and gives the poorest a fair source of income. A problem with this is that the assessment of the impact of the forestry sector on these individuals would prove difficult, faced with a lack of means to acquire that data. 

The author says that the best idea to alleviate poverty for these people is to give them property rights, so that they can buy and sell land, and forest, and become entrepreneurs who improve their lives through self-interest and competition. But, it is important that this be sustainable so that Bolivia can continue to prosper in the future: "the objective is sustainable management from environmental, social and economic perspectives." Forestry is all good and well if it reduces poverty in Bolivia, but if they chop down all the trees and don't plant any new ones, their economy will crash as soon as the last trees fall.

Fortunately, while the assessment of the impact of the forestry sector on the individuals who it is most near is less clear (lack of data issue), there is plentiful info available from satellite data for deforestation. Once invested in, the Bolivian forestry sector could easily use the tools of data science and satellite imagery to assess the rate at which forests are being depleted. If it is too great, the government could work to incentivize or inhibit those industries accordingly, in favor of their long-term sustainability. 

The author further extends this idea, and says that that sector could then be taxed, providing the Bolivian government with more discretionary income to fund a social safety net, or to fund healthcare, or even better, to fund education (which, as proposed in the 1997 paper, would enable Bolivians to assume higher-skill jobs, and thus improve their income even further as they grow a more developed service industry)

The paper does acknowledge the issue of enforcing laws however, that though this may be a very viable opportunity for economic growth, it can only do so under a stable government and economy. As it is so evidently presented in the previous book written in 2019, the Bolivian government is afflicted with instability and plagued by social uncertainty and tension. A new industry cannot boom under a society which cannot enforce property rights of its citizens, and their freedom to capitalize on those natural goods. This idea of securing property rights for Bolivians and was already tried however, and failed to create the ideal "boom" which economists fantasized about.
