# Response to Barder

#### Question 2

Barder made this comparison between the development of Ghana and South Korea to illustrate how to older theory on human development was wrong, (the 5-way cycle, of investment leading to savings leading to more investment, etc.), and further prove his point that human development must be treated much more like an organic mechanism, like a being in and of itself that must evolve. Barder's point is that a country can't just become "developed" simply through one policy change or new institution, it is many many changes, over time, which slowly trend towards a better society. What this "better society" is isn't absolute either, so adding elements of a more developed nation to a less-developed one won't work, because those elements, be they policies or institutions, won't work with the other elements of the less developed nation.



#### Question 6

The Washington Consensus replaced the older five-part cycle of national growth, which was purely an economical model. The older model proposed that investment into an underdeveloped nation directly would lead to its citizens saving more money, thus building more capital and assets, incentivizing further foreign investment. If this were true then undeveloped nations wouldn't exist today, because of all the aid and charity directed their way. These nations can't develop for other reasons which the Washington Consensus covers, such as political and institutional stability. Money alone can't solve these problems, but inorganic institutions won't work either. American-style institutions can't necessarily be imported directly into, say, Ghana, and automatically work. Ghana has to make its own institutions, and they must come about naturally. In another light - who are we, after all, to say what is best for another nation? The best for us may not be the best for them. 





Broad idea: The idea that creative destruction is necessary for countries to develop - in evolution there is natural selection, some thing live others don't... through randomization, order is produced, through random small differences, the strong come out on top, in this case, strong infrastructure, strong government, strong policies, all connected to make a prosperous, stable country. Stability is strength. Certain things must go so that the new may enter, and so that the better replace the worse. Just like we switch from Nokia mobile phones to Smartphones, we must also allow better policies to replace the worse, and so forth....  "survival of the fittest" ...

when it is applied to humans it is then considered "immoral" ... so clearly there are boundaries to this, BUT, those moral lines can be left up to the individual or the county, the town, the state, etc etc







Aside from earlier philosophical class -

only actual right is property rights, given that at present, we live in a finite world
